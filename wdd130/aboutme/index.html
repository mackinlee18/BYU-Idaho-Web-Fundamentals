    <h2>Joseph</h2>
    <h2>Mack</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone, my name is Joseph, but everyone just calls me Mack. I am pursuing a degree in software development, and hope that I will be able to eventually be employed in that field. Right now I am in construction in Phoenix, AZ. I have been married for almost 7 years now, and daughter just turned 1. I love all things nerdy like Star Wars and Lord of the Rings, but also enjoy all sorts of sports.</p>
    <p>I am going after a Bachelors degree in software development, and this is mostly due to wanting a career that I can enjoy, but also will be a stable in demand career. I chose BYU-Idaho because I enjoyed going through Pathways, and it was a smart financial decison to continue on with my degree through BYU. I'm hoping my time getting my degree here will give me a career I love, and employment that allows me to provide for my family.</p>
    <p>As a lifelong member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, BYU-Idaho was also a natural choice. As I have had my testimony grow throughout my life, I have always come back to the scripture Helaman 5:12 for comfort and guidance, and I believe it will help me as I go through college and beyond.</p>
